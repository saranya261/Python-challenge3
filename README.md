# Python-challenge3
This project, Student Performance Analyzer, is a Python-based program developed as part of the Code2Xplore – 60 Days Challenge (Day 3) under the course CSE205 at SRM University–AP. The objective of this project is to analyze internal assessment marks of students by storing them in a list and processing each mark using a for loop and conditional statements. Based on predefined classification rules, each student is categorized as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Average, Fail, or Invalid. The program also counts the total number of valid students and failed students while displaying a clear summary at the end. Additionally, the project includes a personalized logic condition based on student-specific details, fulfilling the mandatory individual logic requirement. This project strengthens fundamental Python concepts such as loops, lists, and decision-making without using advanced data structures or built-in shortcut functions.
